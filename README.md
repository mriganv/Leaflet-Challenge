# Leaflet Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short. The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.


## Level 1: Basic Visualization

* Picking a dataset from USGS (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page to visualize. 

 * Created a basic map to plot and visualize the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. 

 * The data markers on the map reflects the magnitude of each earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake is reflected with its color. Earthquakes with higher       magnitudes appears larger and earthquakes with greater depth appears darker in color.

 * Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.

### Level 2: Advanced Visualization

* Pulled in a second data set and visualize it alongside your original set of data. 

* Created another advanced plot with a second data set alongside the original set of data from the previous one on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

* Added a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Added layer controls to our map.

* Add buttons to both Level-1 and Level-2 maps to navigate between the basic and advanced visualizations.
